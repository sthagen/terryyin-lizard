# The fundamental development guideline for making any changes

## Run Test

Always run all tests instead of just one test file

```bash
python -m pytest   # Run all tests
```

## Automated test practices

* All code and logic need to be covered by unit test
* Try to test end to end, external observable pre and post state change, as much as possible
* Don't mock any code unless it's about file system
